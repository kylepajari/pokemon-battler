Pokemon Battler Web App - 

Allows the user to create an account with a username/password, log in and play a turn-based Pokemon battling game in either Single or local Multi-Player.  The battle system closely matches that of the original GameBoy releases.  Complete with sprites, sound effects, custom battle logic featuring type-advantages, accuracy, critical hits, various status afflictions(poison,burn,paralyze,frozen,sleep,confusion), and much more!  

Single player is a ladder style challenge mode, that has users battling Gym Leaders to collect Badges, unlocking more Leaders to face along the way.  If the user manages to beat all eight Gym Leaders, a more difficult challenge is unlocked! 
The player's Pokemon are all level 50, and the leader's teams are based on an average level, increasing as the user progresses.

Local multi-player allows for two players to create teams anywhere from 1-6 Pokemon, and battle each other in a one off match.

Stores the User's account data in a cloud server, provided by MongoDB.
Uses PokeAPI(https://pokeapi.co/) for sprites, move names, types, and base stats.  All other data was custom coded for this app.

This is a fan project, for personal use only.
