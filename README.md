Pokemon Battler Web App - 

Allows the user to create an account with a username/password, log in play a turn based Pokemon battling game in either Single or local Multi-Player.  The battle system closely matches that of the original GameBoy releases.  

Single player is a ladder style challenge mode, that has users defeating gym leaders to collect badges, unlocking more leaders to face along the way.  If the player manages to beat all 8 gym leaders, a more difficult challenge is unlocked. 
The player's Pokemon are all level 50, and the leader's teams are based on an average level, with that average going up higher up the ladder.

Local multi-player allows for two players to create teams anywhere from 1-6 Pokemon per team, and battle each other in a 1v1 match.
Stores the User's account data in a cloud server, provided by MongoDB.
Uses PokeAPI(https://pokeapi.co/) for sprites, move names, types, and base stats.  All other data was custom coded for this app.

This is a fan project, for personal use only.
